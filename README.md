1. Take a weighted sum of most recent year's stats, and career stats (60/40) split
2. Take in multiple players from each side
3. Use a more advanced website (i.e. baseball reference) to webscrape more "interesting"
data points (like OBP, OPS, WHIP, FIP, WAR, etc.)
4. Enable trading between batters and pitchers
